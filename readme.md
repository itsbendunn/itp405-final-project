What is your site about?
I'm thinking of using the Google Maps API to build a service similar to that of a trip planner. You will be able to type in locations in an order that you'd like to visit them in, get optimal directions from one place to another and find attractions around each location. A user would create an account that would allow them to save places, their trips and add/delete locations as necessary.

What types of users will visit your site?
Anyone who's interested in getting a better experience at trip planning with Google Maps.

Will they need to create an account?
Yes, if they want to save their trips.

What API will you be using?
As of now, the Google Maps API, though more may be needed as development cotinues.

What do you think your tables will be?
A main table for users, one for pinned locations, one for trips, one for pinned attractions around locations and one for comments for each trip.
